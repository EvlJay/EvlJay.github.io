            -1990's : My Grandpa builds our family our first computer. I
            immediately became obsessed with using it, figuring it out, and
            learning as much as I could about it. <br />
            <br />
            During this period, I found out how to view the raw HTML for
            websites and started tinkering writing my own using sites like
            Angelfire to host numerous pages so I could practice HTML.

            -Early 2000's : In high school I continued to dabble with HTML
            until I was able to take a Computer Programming class that
            taught me Visual C++ and I loved it.<br />
            <br />
            After graduating High School in 2002 I started classes at a
            local Community College to get a Computer Programming Degree.
            At this time I was also working full time at a local restaurant
            to pay my way through school.<br />
            <br />
            Being young and horrible with budgeting my money, by the time
            my first semester was completed and it was time to sign up for
            the next set of classes, I was unable to come up with the funds
            to cover the tuition. Since I was working in kitchens already I
            decided to keep working and figure out another way.

            -Mid to Late 2000's : After some time working I decided to Join
            the United States Army. I gained Top Secret clearance and was
            able to sign up to be an Information Systems Analyst, however a
            serious injury ended up forcing me to come home.<br />
            <br />
            This did not deter me from continuing to learn the things that
            I wanted to learn. I went back to work using my training to
            land a position with the NC Department of Corrections as a
            Correctional Officer at the Maximum Security Facility in
            Raleigh, NC. When not working, I was at home still dabbling and
            learning new things as HTML evolved, including CSS and
            Javascript.

            -Late 2000's to Early 2010's : Life went on and my career was
            not going as I had planned; working full time in kitchens
            having nothing to do with computers or technology. But at home
            was a different story.<br />
            <br />
            By this time, I had built quite a few of my own PC's, a passion
            that I got from my Grandfather and never faded. I had also
            learned how to use a number of softwares to create websites
            including Photoshop for graphics, as well as customizing
            MySpace pages for my friends using HTML to modify the profile's
            appearance.<br />
            <br />
            I also got interested in hardware modification and
            customization, and at one point created a fully enclosed fish
            tank that was made from the shell of a G3 Mac. I do not take
            credit for this idea, but I loved the thought of it so much I
            had to have one for myself.

            -Mid 2010's to Now : Lots of things have happened over the
            years. Jobs came and went but I was still in the Food Service
            Industry.<br />
            <br />
            While this was not my desired career, I took pride in what I
            was doing and worked my way up to a Chef title working in
            Corporate Dining for an International Hospitality Company,
            Compass Group. As much as I enjoyed this line of work, it was
            not what I wanted for myself and wanted to make a move before
            it was "too late".<br />
            <br />
            I started by switching things up and moving out of Corporate
            Dining and transitioned into working for a local Farm operating
            their Food Truck. This gave me more free time while still
            bringing in the bill money. It also put me in a more relaxed
            and enjoyable environment, which is always good.<br />
            <br />
            This went on for some time, then it happened. Covid-19.<br />
            <br />
            After the initial shock of what was happening and getting
            laid-off like so many others, I realized that this could be a
            blessing in disguise. This extra time at home gave me the
            opportunity to get online consistantly and take courses and
            learn things I needed to know to change fields and get into IT
            in some way.<br />

            ---------------<br />
            I started looking around online and found out that FCC offered
            a course on Responsive Web Design, which I promptly signed up
            for and completed in June of 2020.<br />
            <br />
            <img src="/assets/fccCert.JPG" /><br />
            After this, I dove into the bottomless pit that is YouTube and
            started learning all kinds of different things, including
            Raspberry Pi projects, Penetration Testing, and Privacy. I also
            found that FEMA offered courses too, so I completed a few of
            them as well.<br />

          <div class="aboutMeSegment">
            Throughout this time I was applying for jobs in the field I
            wanted to be in. Anything that was IT related that was an entry
            level position so I could get my foot in the door. Up to this
            point, it was becoming difficult because I had no actual
            documented experience.

            Transcom<br />
            ---------------<br />
            I got hired on at Transcom in November of 2020. I was assigned
            to work their Apple contract, which provides AppleCare+ support
            to Apple customers. While I technically worked for a 3rd party,
            we reported to Apple directly with training and QA being
            handled by Apple to ensure the level of service met their
            expectations. Within 1 year, I had moved up to a Tier 2 Senior
            iOS/Mac+ Advisor position, handling escalation calls and
            troubleshooting difficult customer hardware and software
            issues.<br />
            <br />
            I will be the first to tell you, I am not an Apple product
            user. But that did not stop me from performing the job to the
            best of my ability. After all, I was finally working on a
            computer, so I could not complain too much. However, after a
            solid year of this, I was not happy doing this type of work and
            started looking for other opportunities.

            Walmart<br />
            ---------------<br />
            In late 2021 a close family friend referred me to apply where
            she worked, as she thought I would be a good fit. The job was
            with Walmart as a Resolution Coordinator III. I quickly applied
            and got the job in January of 2022.<br />
            <br />
            While I am only starting my time at Walmart, I very much enjoy
            the work I am doing and the people I work with, and I have
            learned so much in the short time I have been here. I am
            looking foward to seeing what I can learn here and the
            opportunities they can offer me to move forward in my career.
